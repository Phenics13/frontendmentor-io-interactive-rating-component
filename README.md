## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I practiced my basic skills in React, TypeScript and Styled Components.

### Continued development

As I have said before I am going to focus on using TypeScript in the next challenges. Also I will complete some of them using Next.js in the future. By the way, I am going to try out Tailwind CSS. Wish me good luck ðŸ˜Š
